# Introduction

Iron is a brand new ActionScript 3 engine implemented simultaneously in the browser and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

> NOTICE
>
> Iron is currently not implemented; however there is part of the ActionScript 3 compiler infrastructure implemented in the Rust systems language.

Iron allows you to program user interface skins, layout and logic in the ActionScript 3 and MXML languages, stylizing skins through a subset of the CSS3 language.

## Single Page Applications

A Single Page Application is a website that prevents refreshing the current page when redirecting to another page; in other words, a webpage is responsible for its own physical page and for any other physical page.

Single Page Applications render pages in the client side and the server side. The server side requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to be installed in the host environment.
