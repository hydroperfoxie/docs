## Basic programs

The following program prints "Hello world" to the console:

```
trace("Hello world");
```

The following program defines a range clamping function:

```
function clamp(val:Number, start:Number, end:Number):Number
{
    return Math.min(Math.max(val, start), end);
}
```

The following program defines a global variable:

```
package
{
    public const DELTA:Number = 2 - 7;
}
```

The following program defines a function at the package `com.company.max`:

```
package com.company.max
{
    public function contract(team:Team):void
    {
        trace("a phone call to", team.name);
    }
}
```

The following program defines the representation of a team in a company as an ActionScript class:

```
package com.company.max
{
    public class Team
    {
        private var m_name:String;

        public function Team(name:String)
        {
            m_name = name;
        }

        public function get name():String
        {
            return m_name;
        }
    }
}
```

The following program demonstrates how you basically define and use enumeration types:

```
package com.company.max
{
    public enum Priority
    {
        const LOW;
        const HIGH;
    }
}

import com.company.max.Priority;

var p:Priority = "low";
p = "high";

p = Priority.LOW;
p = Priority.HIGH;

metaInspection();

function metaInspection():void
{
    trace("number of Priority.LOW:", Priority.LOW.valueOf());
    trace("number of Priority.HIGH:", Priority.HIGH.valueOf());

    trace("string of Priority.LOW:", Priority.LOW.toString());
    trace("string of Priority.HIGH:", Priority.HIGH.toString());
}
```

Log:

```plain
number of Priority.LOW: 0
number of Priority.HIGH: 1

string of Priority.LOW: low
string of Priority.HIGH: high
```
