# MXMLC

MXMLC is an ActionScript compiler that compiles the following languages:

* ActionScript 3
* MXML
* A CSS3 subset

It produces the following artifacts:

* JavaScript modules representing physical pages; some for the client, some for the server side
* A JavaScript module that contains application code
* JavaScript source maps mapping back JavaScript to the original ActionScript and MXML sources
* Static media including images and sound

The resulting artifacts may be mounted into a live website through the SkyFlex command line.
