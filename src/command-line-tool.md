# Command line tool

The Steel command line tool (steel) allows you to create, compile and publish your MXML applications, your libraries and your own command line tools.

Command line tool projects require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to be installed in the host environment, as their ActionScript 3 codebase must use the Node.js programming interfaces.
